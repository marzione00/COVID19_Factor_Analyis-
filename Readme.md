The anisotropic spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 raised a scientific challenge about the features that prevent or instead increase its diffusion. In order to get a bird's-eye view on this issue concerning to the first wave (up to 24/08/2020) the principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the following clusters: the Italian provinces, the Italian regions, and a selected set of 150 countries. Such inspection allowed to investigate the disease diffusion not only for a clusters sets of different sizes, but also with different features since, in principle the indices that are available for a set of provinces are different with respect to the ones that are available for a set of countries. It was found that while some features such as the mean income, the GDP and the public transport are positively correlated with a higher number of COVID19 cases, due to the fact that they increase the connectivity of the agents, others that limit the latter, as the unemployment slow the diffusion. Moreover we found that, concerning the health service, the most important factor that is negatively correlated with the COVID19 cases is the normalized number of general practitioner and their normalized number of visits, while a less important role is played by the health quality indices.
